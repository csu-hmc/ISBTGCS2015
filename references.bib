  Abstract                 = {Traditional methods for solving ``inverse problems' usually combine a standard initial-value numerical integration technique with a Gauss--Newton method for optimization. This paper presents an approach that uses neither of the traditional processes. Initial-value integration is replaced by a discretization of the relevant differential-algebraic equations. We then exploit sparse finite difference approximations to the Hessian matrix which permits us to construct a quadratically convergent algorithm for solving parameter estimation problems. Computational results with the approach are presented in a series of examples., Traditional methods for solving ``inverse problems' usually combine a standard initial-value numerical integration technique with a Gauss--Newton method for optimization.

  Abstract                 = {Symbolic equations of motion (EOMs) for multibody systems are desirable for simulation, stability analyses, control system design, and parameter studies. Despite this, the majority of engineering software designed to analyze multibody systems are numeric in nature (or present a purely numeric user interface). To our knowledge, none of the existing software packages are 1) fully symbolic, 2) open source, and 3) implemented in a popular, general, purpose high level programming language. In response, we extended SymPy (an existing computer algebra system implemented in Python) with functionality for derivation of symbolic EOMs for constrained multibody systems with many degrees of freedom. We present the design and implementation of the software and cover the basic usage and workflow for solving and analyzing problems. The intended audience is the academic research community, graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and those in industry analyzing multibody systems. We demonstrate the software by deriving the EOMs of a N-link pendulum, show its capabilities for LATEX output, and how it integrates with other Python scientific libraries â€” allowing for numerical simulation, publication quality plotting, animation, and online notebooks designed for sharing results. This software fills a unique role in dynamics and is attractive to academics and industry because of its BSD open source license which permits open source or commercial use of the code.},

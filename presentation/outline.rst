Slide 1: Title
==============

Human Standing Control Parameter Identification with Direct Collocation
Ton van den Bogert
Jason K. Moore
Cleveland State University


Slide 2:

- Parameter identification of nonlinear systems almost alway has lots of local
  minima
- Show simple pendulum parameter ID problem

Slide 3: Human Controller

- Don't know enough about the platn and controller
- But if you want to to create a robot that acts like a human we can identify a
  controller for the robot
- Mention Park 2004

Slide 4: Problem description

- Plant
- Variables of interest

Slide 5: Direct Collocation

- Mention Betts 2003 paper
- Objective, constraints, etc

Slide 6: Software Implementation

- Symbolics with SymPy
- Generates efficient C code that is just in time compiled
- Show speed results for evaluation of a big problem

Slide 7: Results

Slide 8: Comparison with shooting
